## Prerequisites / Notice

Prior to the course, learners are expected to have:

1.  Completed pre-course survey by **22nd May 2023**:
    https://forms.gle/ArxXNocMcSHZ72bE7

2.  A free account on https://posit.cloud/ (or login with GitHub)

3.  A browser that is one of Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome,
    Arc, Microsoft Edge (not the Internet Explorer)

4.  Access to a laptop or desktop computer (you won't be able to do this
    on a phone or tablet)

5.  Read the following paper:
    https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510

Prior experience in a programming language is not required for this
module, but learners who have worked with data science tools such as R,
RStudio IDE, Jupyter Notebooks, Python, or VS Code may have an advantage
and gain the most from the material.

## Abstract

As the expectations of researchers increase, publishing reproducible
scientific articles becomes essential. However, choosing tools for these
tasks can be difficult.

This 1-hour module aims to guide researchers through these challenges by
introducing the Quarto scientific and technical publishing system for
collaborative scientific writing.

## Objective

This module has the following learning objective:

Learn to use the Quarto file format and the RStudio IDE visual editing mode to produce scholarly documents with citations, footnotes, cross-references, figures, and tables.

## Content

This module offers researchers a hands-on opportunity to learn open
source tools and platforms that are accessible beyond institutional
employment. The participatory live coding teaching technique involves an
instructor writing and narrating code as they teach, and inviting
learners to write and execute the same code.

During the module, participants will learn how to use the Quarto file format to
prepare scholarly documents, including slides, and scientific reports.

While the course will introduce commonly used tools in software
development, they will not be explained in great detail. Instead, the
goal is to expose learners to the tools and concepts, requiring openness
to new ideas.
