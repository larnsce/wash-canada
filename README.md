## Abstract

As the expectations of researchers increase, publishing reproducible
scientific articles becomes essential. However, choosing tools for these
tasks can be difficult. 

This 1-hour module aims to guide researchers through
these challenges by introducing a workflow that utilizes 
the Quarto scientific and technical publishing system for
collaborative scientific writing.
